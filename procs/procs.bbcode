Hey all,

Theres a lot of conversations about procs when it comes to twinking.  Which 
procs are great.  Which procs suck.  How often does something proc.  What are 
the mechanics of it.  So I want to go over the basic types of procs and how they 
work, with a focus on RPPM - as that is the most confusing and least-understood.  
This seems to come up a lot at 19 with Shadowfang's shadow bolt as an event that 
procs elemental force, so that'll be the example I tend to use.

Theres a TL;DR for the bottom if you hate math.  The TL;DR shouldn't come as a 
surprise for anyone.

[SIZE=6]Proc % + ICD[/SIZE]

Internal Cooldown (ICD) procs are some of the oldest and easiest to understand.  
There a proc percentage (say 3%) and an internal cooldown (say 40s).  Once the 
proc happens, it can't proc again until the ICD is up.  Most of these tend to be 
buff-based procs (chance on hit to gain lots of attack power or something).  A 
lot of trinkets early on used this.  Notable ones for low level twinks are 
Flintlocke's Woodchucker and Gnomish X-ray scope.  You know that you won't get 
another proc during the ICD window, so advanced players will weapon switch to a 
different ranged weapon after a proc to take advantage (switch to Incendiary 
Ammo for example).

[SIZE=6]PPM[/SIZE]
Procs Per Minute (PPM) is a bit more complicated, but still fairly 
straightforward.  Crusader is an example of a PPM enchant.  Basically, there a 
PPM value, which is then converted into a % chance for any given hit to proc it 
(known as PPH).  PPH is determined by your weapon speed - specifically (weapon 
speed * PPM / 60).  So the slower your weapon, the higher % per hit.  However 
the actual number of events doesn't come into play.  So if you have a 2h weapon 
with a speed of 3.6, you'll have a higher PPH.  But each hit and ability you use 
can proc it.  So even though its based on attacking once every 3.6 seconds, 
you're going to be using abilities and might have haste - so will be proccing it 
more.
[LIST]
[*]PPH scales with base weapon speed.  It doesn't scale with attack speed buffs 
or haste.

[*]Increasing events (haste, using abilities, etc) gives you more chances to 
proc it, and will increase the total number of procs.
[/LIST]
So an arms warrior with crusader (PPM 1) will have a PPH of (3.6 * 1 / 60) = 6% 
chance on each hit.  Add in haste and the fact that you'll be using abilities 
often, you actually will get much more than 1 proc per minute.

[SIZE=6]RPPM[/SIZE]

This is the big one.  Real Procs Per Minute.  Introduced in MoP (if I remember 
correctly), its a forumula that aims to replace PPM and ICD procs.  It is 
supposed to proc the correct number of times, regardless of the number of 
events.  So [I]on average[/I], an afflicition warlock with multiple dots on 10 
people will proc the same number of elemental force procs as an arms warrior 
auto-attacking.

[QUOTE]Real procs per minute. This means if your trinket has an RPPM of 1, it 
will proc once per minute, on average. If you have an RPPM of 2, it will proc 2 
times per minute on average. With the RPPM system, it doesnâ€™t matter how many 
spells you use or swings you take (like it does on chance-to-proc on hit 
trinkets).[/QUOTE]

So what does that actually mean?  Its easy to say that, but hard to really 
understand.

So lets look at the last big change to RPPM that I know of (things aren't 
documented well, so I dunno if its really the last big change made).  
[URL='https://altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2347&p=21081#p21081']Basically 
a bug was found in the way RPPM worked that meant it always procced really early 
on.[/URL]  While an interested read, what we really want from there is the 
formula.  We're also going to tweak the formula 
[URL='https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/45py8q/rppm_is_bugged_has_been_for_25_years/czzh07p/']based 
on the fix for said bug[/URL].

[CODE]proc_chance = unlucky_streak_prevention *
              (rppm / 60.0) *
              MIN(time_since_last_proc_attempt, 10.0)

unlucky_streak_prevention = MAX(1.0, 1.0 + 3.0 * (time_since_last_proc * rppm / 
60.0 - 1.5))

ON ENTERING RAID BOSS COMBAT:
  SET time_since_last_proc = 0.0
  SET time_since_last_proc_attempt = 0.0[/CODE]

I don't know exactly how well "entering raid boss combat" matches with "entering 
pvp combat" - but in theory, switching the starting variables will only increase 
the proc chance of your first proccable event.

So lets break down that formula.  Theres two key variables, time_since_last_proc 
and time_since_last_proc_attempt.  These should be fairly straightforward to 
understand.  The variable time_since_last_proc is the number of seconds since 
the last proc.  The time_since_last_proc_attempt variable is the number of 
seconds since the last time the game checked for a proc.

So on any event that [I]can[/I] proc, this proc_chance formula is run to 
determine the % chance to proc.  A RNG will make a roll and compare against the 
%.  If you make the proc, great - proc happens and both variables reset to 0.  
If the proc does NOT happen, then the time_since_last_proc_attempt is set to 0 
and the time_since_last_proc is not reset.

So lets break down the unlucky_streak_prevention (USP) variable.  The MAX 
function takes the higher of the two inputs, which in this case are 1.0 and an 
equation.  So if 1+3*(time_since_last_proc * rppm /60 - 1.5) is higher than 1.0, 
then that is used as a multiplier, otherwise the multiplier is 1.0 (which 
changes nothing). So lets put some numbers in there.  Elemental Force is 10RPPM 
(and the most common enchant), so plugging that in gives us that 
unlucky_streak_prevention comes into play only when you haven't had a proc in 9 
seconds for elemental force.  That can go down a bit depending on your haste 
(which increases RPPM).  For Hidden Satyr at 2.5 RPPM, you need to go without a 
proc for 36 seconds to get a bonus.

For say, a rogue in melee range - its pretty unlikely that 
unlucky_streak_prevention is going to kick in.  It can be helpful if you're 
kited for a bit and can't attack though.  So lets assume no USP is happening, 
and the multiplier is 1.0.  On to the rest of it.  Similar to MAX, the MIN 
function picks the smaller of the two inputs.  With that in mind, the rest of 
the equation is: (rppm/60) * MIN(time_since_last_proc_attempt, 10.0).

So the time_since_last_proc_attempt for something like a rogue in melee range 
will be constantly low.  You're attacking pretty often with your weapon and your 
mainhand is attempting a proc whenever you use saber slash or other moves.  With 
elemental force's rppm of 10, we're looking at 10/60 * number of seconds since 
last proc attempt.  So if you have a second between attacks, that MIN function 
will be 1.0 and you'll be looking at a 1/6 (~16.666 - repeating, of course) 
chance of proccing.  More often, you'll be hitting lots of buttons and have an 
even lower chance than that.  If you get out of range for a few seconds, then 
your odds of the next proc are going to be much higher.  With elemental force, 
the RPPM is so high that the MIN function never actually will come into play.  
If you go 6 seconds between proc attempts, you'll have a 100% chance to proc 
elemental force.

So to compare, lets look at Hidden Satyr with 2.5 RPPM.  With 1 second between 
attacks, you're looking at 4.16% chance of a proc.  Its even lower with faster 
events.  Here we can see the MIN function in play.  If you don't have an event 
in 10 seconds, you'll have a 41.66% chance of proccing Hidden Satyr.  And if its 
any longer than 10 seconds, the MIN function will still return 10 - so the base 
proc chance of Hidden Satyr maxes out at 41.66% to happen at 10 seconds without 
a proc attempt.  And remember that Unlucky Streak Prevention doesn't kick in 
until 36 seconds.

So whats all this mean?  Theres a question that most 19 rogues ask at some point 
in time - can Shadowfang's shadow bolt proc elemental force.  The answer is yes, 
the shadow bolt is an event.  The other half of the question is - will 
Shadowfang's shadow bolt proc elemental force more often?  The answer is no.  
Each event basically resets the proc chance down to 0.  So if you have a melee 
hit that does NOT proc elemental force, but does proc shadow bolt...the melee 
hit resets the time_since_last_proc_attempt, so the shadowbolt, which is hitting 
a fraction of a second later, is going to have a very small chance of proccing.

But if it procs on a pistol shot and the shadowbolt is delayed since it takes 
time to travel, then the time between events is bigger and it'll have a better 
chance to proc.  That minuscule possibility and the actual shadowbolt (lol <10 
damage) are what separates Shadowfang from a Bronze Shortsword.

[B]TL;DR[/B]
[LIST]
[*]RPPM happens about the same amount on average, regardless of how frequent 
events that can proc it are.  More events means lower proc chance for each 
event.  Less events means higher proc chance for each event.

[*]I'm a nerd.

[*]Shadowfang is better than Bronze Shortsword (duh), but its a [I]really[/I] 
small difference.
