# xpoff-guides
A collection of my guides/posts for xpoff.com

The guides are in BBCode.

## 19 Quick Start Gearing Guide (BfA)

A guide that aims to provide a quick and easy set of competitive gear for every (even remotely viable) class.

* Aimed at new twinks, so no grandfathered gear is included
* Mostly general/balanced sets are listed.  Often, glass cannon pieces are included.  Advanced twinks will have many sets of gear that they switch with based on the situation.
* Items separated by `>` are general much better.  Items separated by `,` are usually very similar - though will sometimes be in order of best -> worst
* Where difficult items are included, an easier-to-obtain item is also included.
* Farmable epic gear (BoEs) are included, however quest epics are not included due to the sheer number of possible upgrades there are

This guide is my primary focus and is the most often updated.

## 19 Quick Start Gearing Guide (Legion)

The Legion 19 guide is now deprecated and will not see any new changes.  It is only kept for posterity and for anyone using private servers.

## 19 Quick Start Gearing Guide (WoD)

The Warlords of Draenor 19 guide is now deprecated and will not see any new changes.  It is only kept for posterity and for anyone using private servers.

## 110 Quick Start Guide (BfA)

This is basically a primer on how azerite gear from quests work.  Its aimed at 110 twinks, but many of the concepts will also apply to 111 twinks as well.

* Explains how to get ilvl 295/300 azerite gear from quests, and how to best plan your path to get that gear.
* Explains the options for other gear slots (Legion Legendaries, Mythic Antorus, Questing, Tier pieces, etc)
* Does not go into individual class options - gearing and azerite traits are constantly updating, so 110s are expected to do research on their class to know the traits they desire.  This guide will help you find those traits once you know them.
* Note that XP off queues are now separated, so 110s will not likely have any BGs going.  This can possibly be worked around by transferring the 110 to an account that does NOT have BfA.  XP can be turned on since legion's level cap is 110, allowing you to queue with other 110s who don't have BfA.
* Eventually the 110 bracket will be rolled into a 110-119 bracket, which will change gearing significantly due to legendaries no longer working.
* 110s and 111s are still really great at farming islands and dungeons

TODO: Add a list of azerite pieces that drop from BfA world rares that might serve as good alternative pieces depending on the azerite traits. This is very low priority and may not get done.

## Guide to Making Guides

An opinionated guide on how I make guides.  Several notes on BBCode, structure, and the use of formatting to convey information.  This is not the only way to create a guide or the right way to create a guide - but hopefully it makes you think about how your guide conveys information.

TODO:
* Add how to pick colors that don't clash with XPOff's background
* Add using colors alongside wowhead links to create '[Scouting Gloves] of the Quickblade" in the correct color
* Create a template for an individual class guide with fill-in-the-blank sections for Race, Gear, Talents, Strategy, Tactics/Techniques, Macros, etc.
* Create a simple signature template to have clean looking signatures using links, class colors, and spoiler tags.


## Enchant procs (or How RPPM Works)

A post that delves into the mechanics behind common proc mechanics.  Includes RPPM, PPM, and ICD.

## Signature

My XPOff signature BBCode, mostly as a backup.  Feel free to liberally borrow from it.


# Website creation

TODO: Write a script that will render the bbcode in HTML.

* Convert BBCode to HTML and dump into a frame?
* Replace table of content links with necroaqua.github.io links?
* Include wowhead javascript to properly add mouseover item links
* Setup basic nav bar
* Setup table of contents sidebar?
* Set up necroaqua.github.io to display these guides
